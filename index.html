      <h2>Proposition: Closing Clinics Will Reduce Abortion Rates</h2>

        <h3>For the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>

          <figcaption>In high-stress states, fewer clinics were significantly associated with lower abortion rates, supporting the proposition that clinic accessibility influences abortion rates.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h4>Design Decisions and Rationale</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Constructing an Accessibility Stress Index:</strong> Clinics vary in their distribution, accessibility and number across states. The decline rates for some clinics may not accurately reflect the availability of services. Therefore, we constructed an Accessibility Stress Index using the mean of the proportion of women of childbearing age living in counties without a clinic and the proportion requiring interstate abortions. This index quantifies the overall difficulty a state's residents face in accessing abortion services, based on geographic barriers and interstate reliance.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Focusing on States with High Accessibility Pressure:</strong> If all states were considered, relatively accessible abortion services in individual states, such as New York, would mask the correlation between clinics and abortion rates. To control for differences in accessibility, we selected states with an Accessibility Pressure Index ranking of 70th percentile or higher. In these states, residents lack alternatives to clinics, and fewer clinics translate into longer distances and higher costs. This data selection strengthens the argument that fewer clinics significantly reduce abortion rates and prevents the results from being obscured by cross-state abortion trends.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Visual Encoding and Interpretive Design:</strong> We chose to use a scatter plot to illustrate the relationship between the number of clinics (x-axis) and the abortion rate (y-axis), using the color of the dots to represent the value of accessibility pressure. Compared to the vector field image representation, the scatter plot more intuitively demonstrates the positive relationship between the number of clinics and the abortion rate. By adding a linear fit line and text annotations, the data relationship is transformed into an interpretable narrative. As can be seen from the figure, the correlation coefficient between the clinic change rate and the abortion change rate is 0.54, which is a significant positive relationship. This confirms that the reduction in clinics directly leads to a decrease in the abortion rate.

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
          <p>The issue of abortion access we explore is a sensitive ethical issue involving bodily autonomy and religion. The purpose of this visualization is not to make moral or political judgments about abortion itself, but rather to highlight how actions like clinic closures affect individuals' practical ability to exercise reproductive choice. The Accessibility Pressure Index was constructed to make state inequalities visible, not to justify them. Furthermore, the index does not account for socioeconomic status, legal restrictions or cultural stigma, which poses certain limitations.
